- **Language(s):** English (with Indian medical terminology and drug names)
- **License:** [More Information Needed]
- **Domain:** Indian Pharmaceuticals & Medicine Information
- **Primary Use:** Indian medicine information, drug compound analysis, symptom mapping, prescription guidance

### Key Features
- ‚úÖ Indian medicines database knowledge
- ‚úÖ Drug compound information and analysis
- ‚úÖ Symptom-to-medicine mapping
- ‚úÖ Prescription guidance and recommendations
- ‚úÖ Disease diagnosis assistance

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install transformers torch
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM
import torch

# Load model and tokenizer
model_name = "Mayank-22/Mayank-AI"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_name)
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(model_name)

# Example queries for Indian medicines
query1 = "What is the composition of Crocin tablet?"
query2 = "Which medicine is used for fever and headache?"
query3 = "What are the side effects of Paracetamol?"
query4 = "Medicines available for diabetes in India"

# Process query
inputs = tokenizer.encode(query1, return_tensors="pt")

# Generate response
with torch.no_grad():
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs,
        max_length=512,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        temperature=0.7,
        do_sample=True,
        pad_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
    )

response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
print(response)
```

### Advanced Usage
```python
# For more controlled generation about Indian medicines
def generate_medicine_response(question, max_length=256):
    prompt = f"Indian Medicine Query: {question}\nResponse:"
    inputs = tokenizer.encode(prompt, return_tensors="pt")
    
    outputs = model.generate(
        inputs,
        max_length=max_length,
        num_return_sequences=1,
        temperature=0.6,
        do_sample=True,
        top_p=0.9,
        repetition_penalty=1.1
    )
    
    response = tokenizer.decode(outputs[0], skip_special_tokens=True)
    return response.split("Response:")[-1].strip()

# Example usage
question = "What are the uses of Azithromycin tablets available in India?"
answer = generate_medicine_response(question)
print(answer)
```
